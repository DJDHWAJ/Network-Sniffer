Here's a **revised and enhanced version** of your `README.md` for the **Network Sniffer** project:

# Network Sniffer

## Objective
The **Network Sniffer** is a powerful tool designed to capture and analyze network traffic in real time. It is built to help network administrators, security professionals, and forensic analysts monitor network activity, detect suspicious traffic, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and log network data for further analysis. By leveraging packet sniffing, the tool provides deep insights into the network traffic for better security and network management.

## How It Works
1. **Packet Sniffing**: 
   - Captures live packets from a selected network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
   - Uses **Scapy**, a versatile Python library, to perform packet capture and dissection.
   
2. **Packet Analysis**: 
   - Analyzes captured packet headers and payloads for network protocols such as **TCP**, **UDP**, **ICMP**, **HTTP**, and **DNS**.
   - Filters the packets based on protocol to capture specific traffic types.

3. **Logging and Visualization**: 
   - Logs captured packets in a **JSON format** for easy review and analysis.
   - Provides a **real-time GUI** built with **Tkinter** for monitoring network traffic.

4. **Packet Storage and Forensics**: 
   - Stores packets in a structured format for forensic investigations, with an option to export the captured data to JSON files.
   - Offers capabilities to save the logs for later analysis and long-term storage.

## Features
- **Real-time Sniffing**: Capture network traffic live from the selected network interface.
- **Protocol Detection**: Support for detecting and analyzing packets across various protocols, such as **TCP**, **UDP**, **ICMP**, **HTTP**, and **DNS**.
- **JSON Logging**: Captured packets are stored and logged in **JSON format** for easy review and external processing.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: A simple graphical interface powered by **Tkinter** for monitoring packets and controlling the sniffer.
- **Multi-Threading**: Allows packet sniffing in a separate thread to ensure the GUI remains responsive.
- **Packet Export**: Save captured packets to **JSON** for later analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Scapy**:
  - **Why**: Scapy is a powerful Python library used for network packet manipulation and analysis. It allows us to sniff, capture, and dissect network packets in real-time.
  - **Usage**: Scapy was used to perform the actual packet sniffing and analysis, enabling us to capture network traffic from a specified interface and inspect the details of each packet.
  
- **Tkinter**:
  - **Why**: Tkinter is the standard Python library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It was used to create a simple interface for monitoring network traffic and interacting with the sniffer.
  - **Usage**: Tkinter powers the real-time display of captured packets, making it easier for users to visualize network traffic without needing to look at logs manually.
  
- **Logging**:
  - **Why**: Python’s built-in `logging` library was used to log errors, warnings, and informational messages, providing insight into the application’s behavior during packet capture.
  - **Usage**: Logs network packet details in a structured format for troubleshooting, monitoring, and auditing purposes.
  
- **JSON**:
  - **Why**: JSON is a lightweight, human-readable data format that is easy to parse and use in other applications. It was chosen for logging captured packet data for storage and analysis.
  - **Usage**: Used for storing captured packet data in a structured, readable format that can be reviewed, analyzed, or imported into other systems.

## Installation

### Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine. This can be downloaded from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Dependencies**: The following Python packages are required:
  - `scapy`
  - `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)
  - `json` (built-in Python library)
  - `logging` (built-in Python library)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-sniffer.git
   ```
   
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

3. Ensure `tkinter` is installed (it comes pre-installed in most Python installations, but if it's missing, you can install it with your package manager).
   
   - **Windows**: Tkinter should be installed by default. If not, reinstall Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **Linux**: If Tkinter is not installed, use the following command to install it:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```
   - **macOS**: Tkinter is included with Python on macOS by default.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python network_sniffer.py
   ```

### Usage
1. Open the GUI and enter the network interface (e.g., `Ethernet` for Ethernet connection, `Wi-Fi` for wireless).
2. Click on **Start Sniffing** to begin capturing network traffic.
3. Click on **Save Packets** to save the captured packets to a JSON file for later analysis.

## Use Cases
1. **Detecting Suspicious Network Activity**:
   - Identify potential security threats such as **MITM attacks**, **DNS hijacking**, and **brute-force attacks**.
   
2. **Network Debugging**:
   - Capture and inspect network packets to identify issues with network communication, protocol errors, or performance problems.
   
3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Capture and store packets for detailed analysis in security audits or incident investigations.
   
4. **Security Auditing**:
   - Monitor and log DNS or HTTP requests for potential security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
This **Network Sniffer** tool is designed to be simple yet powerful, providing real-time packet sniffing and analysis for network administrators and security professionals. By offering a GUI interface and logging functionality, it simplifies the process of network traffic monitoring and troubleshooting. It also serves as an excellent tool for security audits and forensic investigations.

This tool is a useful asset for anyone who wants to get an insight into their network’s traffic and monitor for malicious or suspicious activities in real time.
